- save lastEditedCell because it should show calculations if you click off it and click back on it
- numpad: button borders when tapped
- make animations: cell animations when tapped, when no more numbers in a text field, when currency rates did update

- handle keyboard press? good idea because somebody who runs it on a computer might test with a kb https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/uikit/how-to-detect-keyboard-input-using-pressesbegan-and-pressesended

- country names property on Currency for search
- refactor: custom colors as an extension?


- make all left and right anchors leading and trailing?
- add sounds

- have the ability to add and remove rows? max 8, min 2 - 4?
